# Horse Racing Game

In this project, you create an interactive horse racing game.

## Requirements:

1. Technology: You need to use Vue 3, TypeScript, Pinia.
2. Generate Horse List: The horse list should contain between 1 to 20 horses and should be randomly generated.
3. Generate Race Schedule: Upon clicking the Generate button, a race schedule must be created consisting of 6 rounds.
4. Start the Race: When the "Start Race" button is clicked, the races should begin, running one round at a time.
5. Display Race Results: The results for each race should appear in the Results field, shown sequentially as each race concludes.
6. Animated Horse Movement: The horses should visibly move during each race.
7. Coding Style: Please structure your code in a way that demonstrates clean and maintainable practices, as if for a large-scale project. Always use TypeScript and do not use "any". Always follow SOLID principles, best practices and clean code. Always write unit tests and end to end tests. Always use BEM methodolgy, nesting and logical properties when writing CSS.

## Rules and Conditions:

1. The game should have a total of 20 horses available for racing.
2. Each horse should be represented with a unique color.
3. Each horse's condition score should range from 1 to 100.
4. Each race should consist of 6 rounds.
5. For each round, select 10 random horses from the available 20.

## Round Specifications: 

The rounds must occur at different lengths in the following
sequence:

○ Round 1: 1200 meters
○ Round 2: 1400 meters
○ Round 3: 1600 meters
○ Round 4: 1800 meters
○ Round 5: 2000 meters
○ Round 6: 2200 meters

## Technical Expectations:

1. Pinia Store: Implement state management to handle and manage the game's data.

2. Component-Based Design: Use Vue components to organize the structure of your code effectively.
